minimalist stylesheet(s) for the sensitive among us

When/if the code becomes of better use-ability this repo will also contain my puppeteer formulae in typescript.

For now there are many hidden items that need hover event application  
(things like tabs), code for which needs integration w/or apart from  
the puppeteer it currently lives with. I put a ton of work into Zen Zsa sass.  
I would like to say it was an honor to work with their styles and  
because I hide their logos in my stylesheet here is my unsponsored endorsement  
in a company I respect and I believe they are likely forgiving this trangression.

All you need to do to enable the interactives is add a show on hover event to them.  
WIP transfering event typescript code.

The right side is WIP but the left is working for 1 hand programming,  
for several languages it seems good. â–¼ means layer 2
If you have any refined stylesheet work in this category
please link me an issue/source  
Stack overflow & git would be nice to have, it is too time consuming todo many  
Can't count the hours I've spent on Zsa.io configuring my board.  
Recommend `Violent monkey` over Tamper monkey if you need a browser extension  
`Violent monkey` it is easy to build from source.  
Tamper monkey is a standard for injecting, but DO NOT install CGYWIN on windows.  
Could not recover from what it did to path & sys/windows terminal binaries.
